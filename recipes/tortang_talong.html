            Tortang talong is breakfast dish from the Phillipines feature eggplant traditionally cooked over an open flame untili charred,
            then peeled, flattened, and dipped in scrambled eggs. The dipped eggplant is then pan fried until the edges are crisp and light.
            It's delicious and simple dish best served with garlic fried rice and a dipping sauce. I personally enjoy it with soy sauce 
            that has a squeeze of lemon, but banana ketchup is most popular.

            In this version of the recipe we will use an oven broiler to cook the whole eggplant.

                        <li>Stab the eggplant with a fork to let heat escape and to prevent your oven from being covered in

                            Flip the eggplant occasionally so it is cooked evenly.

                            let the eggplant steam so the inside is cooked through and softened. Wait about 10 minutes.
