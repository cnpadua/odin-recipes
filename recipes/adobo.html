            Adobo is a very popular dish from the Phillipines. Its dish made up of typically pork or chicken marinated in
            soy sauce and vinegar. I love to make this dish when I'm feeling lazy and want something low effort. There are 
            many variation to cooking this recipe, but the one shown here is definitely the <i>lazy</i> version. Other versions
            marinate the meat overnight or even include sugar.
